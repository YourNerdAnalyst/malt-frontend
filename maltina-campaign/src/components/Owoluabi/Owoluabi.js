            So, to be true to our essence and stay meaningful to our mix of young and mature audience, we created a heartwarming campaign inspired by the insight that ‘family and community is everything to an average Nigerian - especially our Northern audience who value relationships formed throughout their lives.’ 
            </h6>
            <h6 className='animation-on'>
            The campaign idea - Together, Happiness Happens tells stories that happiness is better when shared with Maltina. Tapping into social occasions, we created emotive stories showing quality happiness in togetherness.
