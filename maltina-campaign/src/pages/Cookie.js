          <br></br>
          <p>
          •	Functional Cookies: Functional cookies are essential and help you navigate the website. They enhance the user-friendliness of the website for visitors. These cookies make sure that you only have to pass the age-gate once and that your basket is saved during all the steps of your checkout process. These cookies also help to support website security and basic functionality.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
          •	Analytics Cookies: Analytics cookies help us to understand the behaviour of our visitors and the usage of the website in an aggregated manner. For instance, we can use these cookies to gain insight into how our visitors use our website. This means we can find out what works and what doesn’t, it allows us to continuously improve the website, and measure how effective our advertising and communication is.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
          •	Advertising Cookies: Advertising cookies will remember your product and page preferences and in general that you visited the Website. We strive to provide you with advertisements relevant to you and your interests on other online platforms, where available on the basis of your visits and surfing behaviour on our website and other third-party websites. Based on these interests, we develop a segmented profile and then adapt the content and the advertisements on our website for various groups of customers. Third parties that set cookies via our website may also try to find out what your interests are in this way, and this information may also be used to present you with content or advertisements that appear more likely to be of interest to you on other, non-NB websites. In this case, the information about your current website visit may be combined with information from previous visits to websites other than ours. These advertising cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of advertisements.

          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
          Even if no advertising cookies are used, please note that you will be provided with advertisements on our site; however, these advertisements will not be tailored to your interests. These advertisements can, for instance, be modified according to the content of the website. You can compare this type of content-related Internet advertisement with advertising on television. If, say, you are watching a cookery programme on TV, you will often see an advertisement about cooking products during the advert breaks while this programme is on.
          Third-party social networks (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Linked In) may also place cookies. This enables you to share the content of the Website on social networks. These third parties may use cookies for their own purposes. NB has no influence over how these social media networks make use of your data.
